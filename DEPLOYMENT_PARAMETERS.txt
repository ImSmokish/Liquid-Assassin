DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
================

1. Open Remix IDE (remix.ethereum.org)
2. Load your UltimateAaveLiquidator.sol contract
3. Select the network (Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, or Polygon)
4. Connect your wallet
5. Deploy with the constructor parameters above
6. Save the contract address for each chain

GAS COSTS:
==========

Ethereum: ~$1.00 (most expensive)
Optimism: ~$0.25
Arbitrum: ~$0.25
Polygon: ~$0.25
Total: ~$2.00

IMPORTANT NOTES:
===============

- Replace [YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS] with your actual wallet address
- Make sure you have enough ETH for gas on each chain
- Save the contract addresses - you'll need them for the environment variables
- The contract will be deployed with you as the owner

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES TO UPDATE:
===============================

After deployment, update these in your .env file:
LIQUIDATOR_CONTRACT_1=0x... (Ethereum address)
LIQUIDATOR_CONTRACT_10=0x... (Optimism address)
LIQUIDATOR_CONTRACT_42161=0x... (Arbitrum address)
LIQUIDATOR_CONTRACT_137=0x... (Polygon address)

That's it! Your liquidation bot will be live on all 4 chains.
